                    <h2>Strategy</h2>
                    <p>Highlighting Ola’s brand, AdParlor designed customizable ads to promote awareness in new markets. Each ad featured adjustable elements that were quickly tailored per demographic, geographic location, promotion, and holiday via the Creative Blueprints technology. Using a variety of different creatives allowed Ola to test and discover what creative resonated best with each audience.</p>
                    <p>With a thorough understanding of both Ola’s service and audience, AdParlor developed a multi-channel, go-to-market strategy for driving App Installs. Pairing customized targeting with customized creative, Facebook App Install campaigns – along with Google Universal App Campaigns and Apple Search – were leveraged to promote demand-side installs.</p>
